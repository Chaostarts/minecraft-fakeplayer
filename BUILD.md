# Build introduction

Here is a simple introduction lead you to build this project

## Build NMS Dependencies

Mojang does not allow anyone to publish the remapped NMS jar to any public repository,
so you need to build it yourself

1. Download [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/)
2. execute `java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.21 --remapped` to install remapped NMS 1.21 to your local repository. _You might need to install other version depending on projects' requirements._
